Hi there! I am a PhD student in machine learning at the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, where I am affiliated with the [*Machine Learning Research Group*](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/) and [*Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance*](https://oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/). 

I was born and grew up in a small but lovely city in northern China before leaving home for college. I obtained my Bachelor's Honours degree from the University of Sydney Business School majored in finance and business analytics, during which I was very fortunate to work with professor [Junbin Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3-KJN8IAAAAJ&hl=en) on graph machine learning research. Then I moved to the UK to study for a Masterâ€™s degree in statistics at Oxford, where I finished my thesis on graph Bayesian optimization with professor [Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/), and was very fortunate to become one of his DPhil students.

I would also like to thank [*ESRC Grand Union DTP*](https://www.granduniondtp.ac.uk/) for funding my PhD research!

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
